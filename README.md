# Download JSON, Extract Property Action
Download a JSON payload, extract the property you want, and expose it as a result to be used for the next step

## Usage
Inside your `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` file:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: senmu/download-json-property-action@v1
  with:
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/json'
    property_path: slideshow.author
```

## Input Arguments
This action currently supports two inputs from the user: `url`, and `property-path`.

| Input  | Description | Usage |
| :---:     |     :---:   |    :---:   |
| `url`  | The URL of the JSON to fetch  | Required |
| `property_path`  | The path of the property you want to extract. Deeper properties nested in an object can be retrieved using dot notation thanks to [object-path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path). | Required |

## Output
* `value`: The retrieved value that lives at the specified `property-path`

Below is an example of how to reference this value in a subsequent step.
